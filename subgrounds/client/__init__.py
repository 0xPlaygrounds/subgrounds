""" Top-level Subgrounds subpackage

This subpackage implements the top-level API that most developers will be using when
 querying subgraphs with Subgrounds. `Subgrounds` and `AsyncSubgrounds` contains fully
 implemented subgraph querying SDKs for accessing subgraph data (flattened or nested)
 effectively with transformation and pagination bundled in.

`SubgroundsBase` provides an extended interface to build custom clients on-top allowing
 for intricate customization on the buisness logic subgrounds implements.
